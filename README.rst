Autoswitch Python Virtualenv
============================

|CircleCI| |Release| |GPLv3|

*zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv* is a simple and quick ZSH plugin that switches python
virtualenvs automatically as you move between directories.

*zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv* also automatically detects and activates your **Pipenv** and **Poetry** projects
without any setup necessary.

How it Works
------------

Simply call the ``mkvenv`` command in the directory you wish to setup a
virtual environment. A virtual environment specific to that folder will
now activate every time you enter it.

``zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv`` will detect python projects and remind
you to create a virtual environment. This mainly occurs if one of the following
is found in current the directory:

* setup.py
* requirements.txt
* Pipfile
* poetry.lock

To create a virtual environment for that project, simply run ``mkvenv``.
This command works as expected for all popular python project types
(virtualenvs, pipenv and poetry).

See the Commands_ section below for more detail.

More Details
------------

Moving out of the directory will automatically deactivate the virtual
environment. However you can also switch to a default python virtual
environment instead by setting the ``AUTOSWITCH_DEFAULTENV`` environment
variable.

Internally this plugin simply works by creating a file named ``.venv``
which contains the name of the virtual environment created (which is the
same name as the current directory but can be edited if needed). There
is then a precommand hook that looks for a ``.venv`` file and switches
to the name specified if one is found.

Autoswitch virtualenv also works automatically with projects which contains
a ``.venv`` virtualenv directly created by the ``python -m venv`` command.

For the case of pipenv projects, the plugin will look for a ``Pipfile``
and activates pipenv if it detects an existing virtual environment for it.

For the case of poetry projects, the plugin will look for a ``pyproject.toml``
and activates poetry if it detects an existing virtual environment for it.

**NOTE**: you may want to add ``.venv`` to your ``.gitignore`` in git
projects (or equivalent file for the Version Control you are using).

Installing
----------

``autoswitch-virtualenv`` requires `virtualenv <https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/>`__ to be installed.
You will also need to make sure that ``python`` (without a suffix; both Python 2 and 3 are supported) is available in your ``$PATH``.

Once ``virtualenv`` is installed, add one of the following lines to your ``.zshrc`` file depending on the
package manager you are using:

ZPlug_

::

    zplug "MichaelAquilina/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv"

Antigen_

::

    antigen bundle "MichaelAquilina/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv"

Zgen_

::

    zgen load "MichaelAquilina/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv"

zinit_

::

    zinit wait lucid for MichaelAquilina/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv

oh-my-zsh_

Copy this repository to ``$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins``, where ``$ZSH_CUSTOM``
is the directory with custom plugins of oh-my-zsh `(read more) <https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization/>`_:

::

    git clone "https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv.git" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/autoswitch_virtualenv"

Then add this line to your ``.zshrc``. Make sure it is **before** the line ``source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh``.

::

    plugins=(autoswitch_virtualenv $plugins)

Manual Installation
'''''''''''''''''''

Source the plugin shell script in your `~/.zshrc` profile. For example

::

   source $HOME/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv/autoswitch_virtualenv.plugin.zsh


Pipenv and Poetry Integration
-----------------------------

This plugin will also detect and auto activate virtualenvs made with ``pipenv`` or ``poetry``.
No action needs to be performed in projects where a poetry/pipenv project has already been setup.

Commands
--------

mkvenv
''''''

Setup a new python project with autoswitching using the ``mkvenv``
helper command.

::

    $ cd my-python-project
    $ mkvenv
    Creating my-python-project virtualenv
    Found a requirements.txt. Install? [y/N]:
    Collecting requests (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
      Using cached requests-2.11.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    Installing collected packages: requests
    Successfully installed requests-2.11.1

This command also works as expected with both ``poetry`` and ``pipenv``.

Optionally, you can specify the python binary to use for this virtual environment

::

    $ mkvenv --python=/usr/bin/python3


In fact any parameters passed to mkvenv will be passed to the relevant setup command.
The same applies to passing additional parameters to ``pipenv install`` and ``poetry install``.

Autoswitching is smart enough to detect that you have traversed to a
project subdirectory. So your virtualenv will not be deactivated if you
enter a subdirectory.

::

    $ cd my-python-project
    Switching virtualenv: my-python-project  [Python 3.4.3+]
    $ cd src
    $ # Notice how this has not deactivated the project virtualenv
    $ cd ../..
    Switching virtualenv: mydefaultenv  [Python 3.4.3+]
    $ # exited the project parent folder, so the virtualenv is now deactivated

rmvenv
''''''

You can remove the virtual environment for a directory you are currently
in using the ``rmvenv`` helper function:

::

    $ cd my-python-project
    $ rmvenv
    Switching virtualenv: mydefaultenv  [Python 2.7.12]
    Removing myproject...

This will delete the virtual environment in ``.venv`` and remove the
``.venv`` file itself. The ``rmvenv`` command will fail if there is no
``.venv`` file in the current directory:

::

    $ cd my-non-python-project
    $ rmvenv
    No .venv file in the current directory!

Similar to ``mkvenv``, the ``rmvenv`` command also works as you would
expect with removing ``poetry`` and ``pipenv`` projects.

disable_autoswitch_virtualenv
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Temporarily disables autoswitching of virtualenvs when moving between
directories.

enable_autoswitch_virtualenv
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Re-enable autoswitching of virtualenvs (if it was previously disabled).

Customising Messages
--------------------

By default, the following message is displayed in bold when an alias is found:

::

    Switching %venv_type: %venv_name [%py_version]

Where the following variables represent:

* ``%venv_type`` - the type of virtualenv being activated (virtualenv, pipenv, poetry)
* ``%venv_name`` - the name of the virtualenv being activated
* ``%py_version`` - the version of python used by the virtualenv being activated

This default message can be customised by setting the ``AUTOSWITCH_MESSAGE_FORMAT`` environment variable.

If for example, you wish to display your own custom message in red, you can add the
following to your ``~/.zshrc``:

::

    export AUTOSWITCH_MESSAGE_FORMAT="$(tput setaf 1)Switching to %venv_name üêç %py_version $(tput sgr0)"

``$(tput setaf 1)`` generates the escape code terminals use for red foreground text. ``$(tput sgr0)`` sets
the text back to a normal color.

You can read more about how you can use tput and terminal escape codes here:
http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes


Options
-------

The following options can be configured by setting the appropriate variables within your ``~/.zshrc`` file.

**Setting a default virtual environment**

You can set a default virtual environment to switch to when not in a python project by setting
the value of ``AUTOSWITCH_DEFAULTENV`` to the name of a virtualenv. For example:

::

    export AUTOSWITCH_DEFAULTENV="mydefaultenv"

**Setting a default python binary**

You may specify a default python binary to use when creating virtualenvs
by setting the value of ``AUTOSWITCH_DEFAULT_PYTHON``. For example:

::

    export AUTOSWITCH_DEFAULT_PYTHON="/usr/bin/python3"

You may still override this default as usual by passing the --python parameter to
the mkvenv command.

**Autoswitch file name**

By default, the `.venv` file (or virtualenv directory) is searched for in each
directory in order to tell if a virtualenv should be automatically activated.

If this needs to be changed (e.g. it conflicts with something else) then it may be
changed by setting the value of ``AUTOSWITCH_FILE``. For example:

::

    export AUTOSWITCH_FILE=".autoswitch"

**Default requirements file**

You may specify a default requirements file to use when creating a virtualenv by
setting the value of ``AUTOSWITCH_DEFAULT_REQUIREMENTS``. For example:

::

    export AUTOSWITCH_DEFAULT_REQUIREMENTS="$HOME/.requirements.txt"

If the value is set and the target file exists you will be prompted to install with that file
each time you create a new virtualenv.


**Set verbosity when changing environments**

You can prevent verbose messages from being displayed when moving
between directories. You can do this by setting ``AUTOSWITCH_SILENT`` to
a non-empty value.

**Choosing where virtualenvs are stored**

By default, virtualenvs created are placed in ``$HOME/.virtualenvs`` - which is
the same location that the ``virtualenvwrapper`` package uses.

If you wish to change this to another location, simply set the value of the
environment variable ``AUTOSWITCH_VIRTUAL_ENV_DIR``.

If you wish for virtual environments to be stored within each project directory
then you can set the variable to use a relative path. For example:

::

    export AUTOSWITCH_VIRTUAL_ENV_DIR=".virtualenv"

**Customising pip install invocation**

By default `mkvenv` will install setup.py via pip in `editable (i.e. development) mode
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs>`__.
To change this set ``AUTOSWITCH_PIPINSTALL`` to ``FULL``.

**Deactivating active Conda environment**

By default, virtual environments are activated without checking if any Conda environment is active.
When one is, your prompt may display information about virtualenv being active, but in reality
the Conda environment will still be used.

To avoid such confusing behaviour, you can have the Conda environment deactivated automatically
(and then switched back when leaving the directory), set the value of the environment variable
``AUTOSWITCH_DEACTIVATE_CONDA`` to a non-empty value.

Security Warnings
-----------------

zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv will warn you and refuse to activate a virtual
environment automatically in the following situations:

-  You are not the owner of the ``.venv`` file found in a directory.
-  The ``.venv`` file has weak permissions. I.e. it is writable by other users on the system.

In both cases, the warnings should explain how to fix the problem.

These are security measures that prevents other, potentially malicious
users, from switching you to a virtual environment you did not want to
switch to.

Running Tests
-------------

Install `zunit <https://zunit.xyz/>`__. Run ``zunit`` in the root
directory of the repo.

::

    $ zunit
    Launching ZUnit
    ZUnit: 0.8.2
    ZSH:   zsh 5.3.1 (x86_64-suse-linux-gnu)

    ‚úî _check_venv_path - returns nothing if not found
    ‚úî _check_venv_path - finds .venv in parent directories
    ‚úî _check_venv_path - returns nothing with root path
    ‚úî check_venv - Security warning for weak permissions

NOTE: It is required that you use a minimum zunit version of 0.8.2
